# üåê IP Tracker Script: Stay Connected with Your Changing Network

## Overview
This Python script serves as a dynamic **IP address tracker** that not only monitors your current IP but also logs changes in real-time. Perfect for users who frequently switch networks or need to keep an eye on their IP for security and connectivity purposes, this script combines functionality with a touch of flair!

## Features

- **Instant IP Check:**  
  With the press of the **'p'** key, you can instantly display your current public IP address. This feature is powered by a hotkey registered using the `keyboard` library, ensuring seamless user interaction.

- **Real-Time Monitoring:**  
  The script runs in an infinite loop, checking for changes in your public IP every second. If a change is detected, it captures the moment with a timestamp and logs the new IP address to a text file.

- **Detailed Logging:**  
  Each time your IP changes, the script appends an entry to a log file (`ip_log.txt`), creating a chronological record of your network transitions. This is invaluable for troubleshooting connectivity issues or maintaining a secure network environment.

- **User-Friendly Output:**  
  Not only does the script log changes, but it also prints them to the console in real time, allowing you to stay updated on your network status at a glance.

## Why Use This Script?
Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a network administrator, or someone who frequently travels, this script provides a convenient way to monitor your IP address. With minimal setup and easy access to critical information, you can navigate your online presence with confidence.

## Get Started
To use this script, ensure you have the `keyboard` library installed and run it in an environment where Python can execute shell commands. You‚Äôll have real-time insights into your network connectivity and an automatic log of your IP changes‚Äîkeeping you informed and in control!
